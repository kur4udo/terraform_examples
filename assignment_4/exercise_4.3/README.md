# Exercise 4.3 - outputs

In this exercise we will learn how to create outputs.

1. Edit main.tf file.
2. Create output for region variable and add sensitive attribute.
3. Create outputs for each bucket. As a return value use bucket id attribute.

When we execute our code, terraform will print outputs of region and buckets ids to the console.
