# Exercise 5.2 - EC2

In this exercise we will create (use) all elements needed to run AWS EC2 virtual machine.

Sections:

1. 5.2.1 - AMI data
2. 5.2.2 - Default VPC
3. 5.2.3 - Security group
4. 5.2.4 - EC2
5. 5.2.5 - Public key

As a result, we will get Amazon Linux virtual machine with public key and security group that allows SSH connections.
